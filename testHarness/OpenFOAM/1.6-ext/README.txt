Warning #1: Make sure your OpenFOAM environment is properly initialized before
            running the test harness.

Warning #2: It is required to use cmake version 2.8.8 or newer for
            running the test harness.


1: Instructions for starting a local test harness on your machine:
------------------------------------------------------------------

a) You can set your local system identifier using the environment variable
   $CDASH_SUBMIT_LOCAL_HOST_ID.  Please try using a unique identifier like
   your machine's hostname. Otherwise, the fully qualified name of your system
   will be used.

b) In order to run the test harness in parallel using many cores or processors,
   make sure to initialize the environment variable WM_NCOMPPROCS to the number
   of required processors.
   If the environment variable WM_NCOMPPROCS is left uninitialized, the test
   harness will run on a single processor.

c) Install the CMakeLists.txt and CTestConfig.cmake files by executing the following commands:

   cp ./CMakeFiles/CMakeLists.txt $WM_PROJECT_DIR
   cp ./CMakeFiles/CTestConfig.cmake.openfoam-extend $WM_PROJECT_DIR/CTestConfig.cmake


d) Run the test harness and push your results on the CDash server on openfoam-extend

   cd ./runDir; ./Allclean; ./Allrun_Experimental
     or
   cd ./runDir; ./Allclean; ./Allrun_Nightly


2: Instructions for restarting your setup from scratch:
-------------------------------------------------------
cd ./runDir; ./Allclean


3: About submitting your results
--------------------------------

Both Allrun_Experimental and Allrun_Nightly scripts will submit their results
to the CDash server of your choice, as specified by the file
$WM_PROJECT_DIR/CTestConfig.cmake.

To submit your results to the CDash server on openfoam-extend, just use
the file CTestConfig.cmake.openfoam-extend.

If submitted to the CDash server on openfoam-extend, your results will be displayed here:
http://openfoam-extend.sourceforge.net/CDash/index.php?project=OpenFOAM-1.6-ext



4: Running individual tests
---------------------------

Here are the instructions for running individual tests from the test harness

1: cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR/testHarness/OpenFOAMÂ®/1.6-ext/runDir

2: Configure the test harness

    ./Allrun_CMakeOnly

3: List available tests, along with their individual test number:

    ctest -N

4: Running an individual test:

    ctest -I xxx (where xxx is the number associated with the test you wish to run)


You can also select a bunch of tests using regular expressions. See here for more information:

    http://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest#Running_Individual_Tests

When running individual tests like this, the result of the test will not be uploaded to the Dashboard service.
